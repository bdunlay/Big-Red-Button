Big-Red-Button
==============

Acts as a HID Keyboard to send key entries to my PC, inspired by [Victor Laynez](http://roteno.com) and his submission to [Hack-A-Day](http://hackaday.com/2014/01/29/satisfying-way-to-build-projects/).

Special Instructions
--------------------
Follow [@roteno's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBbFbR4EEoc&list=UUfnEMfoApmVJunf27znatsA&index=1) instructions to turn it from a locking switch to a momentary switch. Screwdriver required.

What am I using this for?
-------------------------
I currently work at Microsoft. My first use of this will be at work, where I'll build Windows Phone OS after I've made changes. I intend on expanding it with an XBee to tie it into another project of mine, which I will explain at a later date!

Enjoy the satisfying press of the red button [again and again and again](https://t.co/8z2WQdCsTY).
